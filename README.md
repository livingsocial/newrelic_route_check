# NewrelicRouteCheck

Compares New Relic controller_summary.csv to the routes defined in a Rails app

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'newrelic_route_check'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install newrelic_route_check

## Usage

This gem requires the `controller_summary.csv` file from New Relic. To
download, go to: Monitoring tab > Transactions.

Make sure to select these two options:
1) Type: "Web".
2) Date range: Preferably with the 7 day history to have the best coverage.

Click on link "Show all transactions tableâ€¦". Click on "Export as CSV". Save the file to `./tmp/controller_summary.csv`.

Run: `bundle exec rake newrelic:compare_with_routes`, which should give output of routes that are defined in your app but not receiving any traffic.
